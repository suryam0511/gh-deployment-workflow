# GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
using GitHub Actions.

## What it does
- Automatically deploys a static website to GitHub Pages
- Deployment triggers only when `index.html` is modified

## Live Website
https://surya0511.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/

## How it works
- Push changes to the `main` branch
- If `index.html` changes, GitHub Actions runs
- The website is deployed to GitHub Pages
